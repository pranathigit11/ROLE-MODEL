<b>Pengu</b> (Penguins are flightless, semi-aquatic birds, mostly found in the Southern Hemisphere, famous for their distinctive black-and-white coloring and expert swimming skills, using their wings as flippers to catch krill and fish, though they waddle awkwardly on land. They have thick blubber and waterproof feathers for insulation, ranging from the tiny Little Blue to the massive Emperor Penguin, and live in large colonies, caring for their young in rookeries. )
